# Milestone 1: Microservices Infrastructure Setup ✅

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Date:** October 30, 2025

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Project Restructure

```
apps/backend/
├── gateway/              # API Gateway (Port 3001)
├── auth-service/         # Authentication & User (Port 3003)
├── product-service/      # Products & Categories (Port 3003)
├── cart-service/         # Shopping Cart (Port 3004) - Structure created
├── order-service/        # Orders & Payments (Port 3005) - Structure created
└── notification-service/ # Emails & Notifications (Port 3006) - Structure created

├── common/              # Shared utilities, DTOs, interfaces, decorators
├── config/              # Shared configuration utilities
└── database/            # Prisma clients per service
```

### 2. Shared Packages Created

#### @empora/common

- **DTOs:** PaginationDto, HealthCheckDto
- **Interfaces:** ServiceHealthCheck, PaginationParams, PaginatedResponse, ApiResponse
- **Decorators:** @Public(), @Roles()
- **Constants:** Service names, RabbitMQ queues/exchanges, user roles
- **Utils:** Order number generation, pagination calculation, email sanitization

#### @empora/config

- Configuration interfaces for Database, RabbitMQ, Redis
- Config validation utility

#### @empora/database

- Base Prisma service interface
- Foundation for database per service pattern

### 3. Infrastructure Setup

#### Docker Services

- ✅ PostgreSQL 16 (Port 5432) - Healthy
- ✅ Redis 7 (Port 6379) - Healthy
- ✅ RabbitMQ 3 with Management UI (Ports 5672, 15672) - Healthy

#### Database Strategy

- **Pattern:** Database per service (using PostgreSQL schemas)
- **Auth Schema:** Users, RefreshTokens
- **Product Schema:** Products, Categories
- Migrations completed successfully for both services

### 4. API Gateway

- HTTP reverse proxy architecture
- Routes requests to microservices
- Health check aggregation across all services
- CORS configuration
- Global validation pipes
- Proxy controllers for auth and product services

**Endpoints:**

- `GET /api/health` - Aggregate health check
- `GET /api/health/gateway` - Gateway-specific health
- `/api/auth/*` - Proxied to auth-service
- `/api/products/*` - Proxied to product-service

### 5. Auth Service

- User management with Prisma
- JWT-ready structure (implementation in next milestone)
- Role-based access control foundation
- Health check with database connectivity
- Refresh token management structure

**Endpoints:**

- `GET /health` - Service health and database status

**Tested:** ✅ Service running, database connected, health check working

### 6. Product Service

- Product and Category management structure
- Hierarchical category support
- SKU and inventory tracking
- Health check with database connectivity

**Endpoints:**

- `GET /health` - Service health and database status

### 7. Dependencies Installed

- `@nestjs/axios` - HTTP client for service communication
- `@nestjs/microservices` - Microservices support
- `@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq` - RabbitMQ integration (to be configured)
- `amqplib` - AMQP protocol support
- All Prisma clients generated

## Known Issues & Notes

1. **RabbitMQ Integration:** Temporarily disabled due to API configuration issues. Will be re-enabled in next milestone with proper event-driven communication.

2. **Port Configuration:** Auth service currently running on port 3003 (can be adjusted via .env file).

3. **Gateway Testing:** Gateway service structure complete but not fully tested with running microservices yet.

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Start Docker services
docker-compose up -d

# Check Docker status
docker ps

# Test auth-service health
curl http://localhost:3003/health

# Start auth-service (for development)
cd apps/backend/auth-service
npx tsc && node dist/main.js

# Start product-service (for development)
cd apps/backend/product-service
npx tsc && node dist/main.js

# Start gateway (for development)
cd apps/backend/gateway
npx tsc && node dist/main.js
```

## Database Migrations

```bash
# Auth service
cd apps/backend/auth-service
npx prisma migrate dev

# Product service
cd apps/backend/product-service
npx prisma migrate dev
```

## What's Next: Milestone 2

**Focus:** Authentication & User Service Implementation

Planned features:

1. Complete JWT authentication (login, register, refresh tokens)
2. Password hashing with bcrypt
3. Email verification flow
4. User CRUD operations
5. Role-based guards and decorators
6. Auth integration tests
7. Gateway authentication middleware

## Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Communication:** REST APIs between services (HTTP)
2. **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ for async events (to be implemented)
3. **Database:** Database per service using PostgreSQL schemas
4. **Gateway Pattern:** HTTP reverse proxy for external API
5. **Shared Code:** Workspace packages for common utilities

## Files to Review

- `docker-compose.yml` - Infrastructure services
- `packages/common/src/*` - Shared utilities
- `apps/backend/gateway/src/*` - API Gateway implementation
- `apps/backend/auth-service/src/*` - Auth service
- `apps/backend/product-service/src/*` - Product service
- `apps/backend/*/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schemas

**Milestone 1 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Core microservices infrastructure is set up, Docker services running, services can be started individually and communicate.
